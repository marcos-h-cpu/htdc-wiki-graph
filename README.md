A web-based tool that generates interactive network graphs to visualize Wikipedia "rabbit holes". Guided more by impulse than intention. This kind of exploration, while fun and immersive, can also be disorienting and anti-retentive, making it difficult to recall where we've been or how one idea led to another. The aim is to give users a clearer view of hyperlink-driven exploration.

At the core of the project is a network graph where each node represents a Wikipedia article, and edges represent the hyperlinks users followed between articles. Clicking on a node will allow the user to view an intro to the wikipedia article contents and other data pertaining to that article.

By focusing on the user’s path this project offers a more personal and digestible way of understanding how knowledge branches and connects.It’s part learning tool, part constellation of thought you can share with others, inviting conversations about half-remembered ideas/concepts  and the strange logic of how we wander.

Ultimately, this project is both a technical exercise in graph-based visualization and a reflection on how we consume knowledge online. By making the rabbit hole visible, we can better understand our patterns of curiosity and learn to retain more along the way.
